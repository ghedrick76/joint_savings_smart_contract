# joint_savings_smart_contract
A smart contract created using Solidity to allow for the features of a joint savings account to be used by a bank for their customers.


This program allows the user to set up a joint savings account.  Within, there are functions to deposit, withdraw, set the address for each of the two accounts, and a fallback.

The user can check the balance of the contract, the last address to withdraw, and the amount that was withdrawn.

Images of each function in action can be viewed by clicking [here](https://github.com/ghedrick76/joint_savings_smart_contract/tree/main/Execution_Results)
